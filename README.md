FOR IEEE ACCESS PAPER
Software-Defined MANET Swarm for Mobile Monitoring in Hydropower Plants
XI CHEN, TAO WU, GANG SUN and HONGFANG YU

Warning: Programs in this project requires proper installation of various Python libraries. Failure to install these libraries would fail the successful running.
Usage: python3 swarm_peer.py
This starts the automatic MANET swarm networking. It requires only Scapy.
We have commented some lines in swarm_peer.py (lines 7-8, lines 387-393) in order to demonstrate the proper running of automatic MANET swarm networking.
You can uncomment these lines to enable functions like moving, camera, etc. But you must install various Python libraries. And these functions are somehow hardware-specific.
